When an attribute is added/changed in an element, you can chose the directives to use:
    - replace the element with updated attributes, 
    - replace/add the single attribute on the element
Custom code needed for Representations/Segments? What makes a representation unique, a combination of attributes?
    - I.E. Can you use (minimal amount) attribute values to identify distinct Segments/Representations (Basically how to handle when An Id Field does not exist)


Ratio of identical bytes in MP1 vs MPD2 and use ratio to determine replacement of element vs attibute
Size of attribute doesnt matter, size of element matters

Bandwitdh is unique, id is always unique

Segments:
- order required (ascending t)
- t and d wont change, r can
- when sorting by r * d , multiply by r+1, (if r=-1 has to be last in segments)
